1. ### Brushing
    Brushing helps to remove the food particles present in teeth and gums. It's important to brush twice daily following the proper technique. There are various types of toothbrushes available: electric and manual. Typically, it doesn't make a huge difference between these two if we are doing it in the  proper way. Electric toothbrushes make brushing easy for children and people with limited manual dexterity. It is timed as well. 

    Soft, medium and hard toothbrushes are available. For the majority of people, soft and medium brushes are fine. Harder brushes tend to damage gums and teeth if used in the improper way. Most of the toothpastes have the  same basic ingredients and some extra components. 

    It is important to choose one with fluoride. Fluoride helps to prevent formation of decay on teeth. In children with less than 6 years, toothpastes with low fluoride content should be used. In children with less than 2 years, no toothpastes are needed. These two advice can be followed for children with low risk to develop decay  in teeth. If otherwise indicated, you have to follow dentist's advice. It is said that parents have to supervise their children's brushing till 7-8 years. You can set a timer for the children for brushing. Build a habit of brushing their teeth twice daily from the childhood itself so that it will be good for their adult teeth as well. 

2. ### Flossing
    There are gaps present between teeth. Normal brushes we use don't reach these areas. So it's necessary to use something extra to remove food particles from these gaps. 

3. ### Interdental brushes
    These aim to remove the food particles between the teeth. There are various sizes available. You can use a brush appropriate for the size of the space between your teeth â€“ you may need to use more than one size. Insert the brush gently between your teeth, but don't try to force the brush into the space. 

    Do the whole of your mouth so you don't miss any of the spaces. 

4. ### Mouthwash
    There are different types of mouthwashes available. Antiseptic mouthwashes, mouthwashes that prevent decay, anti-inflammatory mouthwashes, mouthwashes for pain relief as well. Ask your dentist for the type  of mouthwash you need. Alcohol based mouthwashes can cause profound drying of the mouth. 

5. ### Enough water
    Keep you hydrated always. Dry mouth has some effects on your mouth. It's also important to drink fluoridated water. 

    Reduce sugar: Excess sugar can lead to formation of decay on teeth. 

6. ### Sugar free chewing gums
    Chewing sugar free gums stimulate the production of more saliva in your mouth. If there is more saliva, more protection for your teeth. 

7. ### Regular visit to dentist
    Dentist can thoroughly check your mouth and can identify any problems at its initial stage itself. It's advisable to do a professional cleaning every 6 months.
